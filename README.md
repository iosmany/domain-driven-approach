# .NET EF Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Implementation

This repository demonstrates a practical implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with .NET and Entity Framework (EF). It showcases how to structure a solution based on DDD principles, including the use of entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, and domain services.

## Features

The project provides a reference for developers who want to adopt a DDD approach in their .NET applications, with examples of how to implement:

- **Entities**: Representing domain objects with a unique identity.
- **Value Objects**: Defining concepts with no identity, characterized by attributes.
- **Aggregates**: Grouping related entities and value objects together.
- **Repositories**: Managing data access and persistence for aggregates.
- **Domain Services**: Encapsulating business logic that doesnâ€™t belong to an entity or value object.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core (or .NET 5/6/7 depending on the version you're using)
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server (or any other database supported by EF Core)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
